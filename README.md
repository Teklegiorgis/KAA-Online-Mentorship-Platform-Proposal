Kallamino Special High School is revitalizing its Alumni Association (KAA) to foster stronger connections and support current students. As part of this initiative, I am proposing  an online mentorship platform that links accomplished alumni with students, offering valuable career guidance, industry insights, and real-world expertise.

Developed collaboratively by volunteer alumni developers and student practtioners, this platform promotes Experience-sharing, mentorship, and hands-on learning. By joining this effort, you can play a key role in shaping the future of Kallamino!
